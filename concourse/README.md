## Concourse pipeline configuration and scripts

This directory contains pipelines, task files, and scripts to run various sets of builds and tests on [our Concourse continuous integration server](http://gpdb.ci.pivotalci.info/).

This work is dependent on [GPDB concourse scripts](https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpdb/tree/master/concourse).

[Learn more about Concourse overall](http://concourse.ci/)

### Prerequisites

- An S3 bucket for your pipeline to use
- GPDB installation (unless you want to compile from source)
- fly CLI

### How to create a pipeline:

- Log in to https://gpdb.ci.pivotalci.info/ gpdb team
- Download and install fly CLI from the links on the lower right corner
- Create a yml file to replace the various variables from the pipeline
- Use fly set-pipeline command

### Examples

Create a pipeline for MADlib stable running on GPDB master:

fly -t gpdb set-pipeline -p dev:madlib_<myid> -c ./incubator-madlib/concourse/pipelines/madlib_pipeline.yml -l <path-to-secrets>/madlib-ci-secrets.yml -l <path-to-secrets>/gpdb_master-ci-secrets.yml

Create a pipeline for MADlib master running on GPDB stable:

fly -t gpdb set-pipeline -p dev:madlib_master_<myid> -c ./incubator-madlib/concourse/pipelines/madlib_master_pipeline.yml -l <path-to-secrets>/madlib-ci-secrets.yml -l <path-to-secrets>/gpdb-release-secrets.dev.yml
