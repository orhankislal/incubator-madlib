<title>Welcome to MADlib</title>

<h2>Welcome to Apache MADlib (incubating)!</h2>
<p>This installer will guide you through the process of installing MADlib onto
your computer.</p>
<p>
Apache MADlib is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further
review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
