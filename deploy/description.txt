Apache MADlib (incubating) is an open-source library for scalable
in-database analytics. It provides data-parallel implementations
of mathematical, statistical and machine learning methods for
structured and unstructured data.

The MADlib mission: to foster widespread development of scalable
analytic skills, by harnessing efforts from commercial practice,
academic research, and open-source development.

Apache MADlib is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further
review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects.

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the
completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the
project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
